So my movement alarm in a dark place is complete - and also turned into a light activated alarm too. Thanks to the low power used (due to Deep Sleep) the batteries on both projects should last for at least 1 year.

The PCB in this project, made by PCBWay.com, was panelised, meaning the PCBs were joined together. This is essential when creating boards for SMD assembly but otherwise it's actually cheaper to have them made singly.

CoolTerm - a great alternative to PUTTY. Freeware but he accepts donations. Yes, I donated $10. It's worth it.
